## üîß Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Understand the users**: Read caregiver stories in our Slack
2. **Check existing work**: Browse open issues and PRs
3. **Discuss big changes**: Share ideas in Slack first
4. **Consider accessibility**: Every feature should work for seniors

### Code Standards

#### Accessibility First
```typescript
// ‚ùå Don't
<button onClick={handleClick}>Save</button>

// ‚úÖ Do
<button 
  onClick={handleClick}
  aria-label="Save memory"
  className="text-xl p-4 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"
>
  <SaveIcon className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
  Save Memory
</button>
```

#### Clear Error Messages
```typescript
// ‚ùå Don't
throw new Error("Failed to save")

// ‚úÖ Do
throw new Error("Unable to save your memory. Please check your internet connection and try again.")
```

#### Privacy by Design
```typescript
// Always encrypt sensitive data
const encryptedMemory = await encrypt(memoryData, familyKey)
// Never log personal information
logger.info("Memory saved", { id: memory.id }) // No content
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, empathetic language:

```
‚úÖ Good examples:
